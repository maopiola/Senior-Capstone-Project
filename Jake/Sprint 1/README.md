In-Building Navigation System Project

(Original Text)Navigating through large building continues to be a challenge, especially when you are infrequently visiting such buildings. Hospitals and Government facilities, libraries, museums often fall under this category. Your goal is to build a beacon based in building navigation system, which can help guide the visitor in the building using the mobile phone.

Your first day at University can be overwhelming, and finding your lecture hall should be the least of your concerns. Our proposed solution will provide students web access to a mapping tool for the building of their choice. This will allow them to display their current location, and route to another selected location in the building, through a convenient web-based tool.
